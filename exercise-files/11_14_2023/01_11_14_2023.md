## Classes, Object, Object initiation

```java
// Creating a class 2 fields/variables - instance variables
// Class is just a blue print of an Object that you are going to build
class Account {
    public int id;
    public String type;

    //No Argument constructor
    public  Account(){}

    // All args constructor
    public Account(int id, String type){
        this.id = id;
        this.type = type;
    }
}
```

### Instantiating Object, No Args vs All Args Constructor

#### Primitive vs Reference Types

**Primitive types**
```
# Primitive types
byte: 8 bits (1 byte)

Range: -128 to 127
short: 16 bits (2 bytes)

Range: -32,768 to 32,767
int: 32 bits (4 bytes)

Range: -2^31 to 2^31 - 1
long: 64 bits (8 bytes)

Range: -2^63 to 2^63 - 1
float: 32 bits (4 bytes)

Represents single-precision floating-point numbers.
double: 64 bits (8 bytes)

Represents double-precision floating-point numbers.
char: 16 bits (2 bytes)

Represents a single Unicode character.
boolean: Size is platform-dependent (usually not specified)

Represents a true or false value.
```
* Java comes with ```8 Primtitve types``` which are listed above, we have to use them accordignly based on our use case.
* Because each data types has their memory bound limit, example if you are declaring an amount field for an Account, it is better to use ```long``` than ```int``` because long is **64 bit** where as int is only **32 bit**.

**Reference types**

* ```Reference type``` are the one where we create instance of class which we created.
* You can instantiate the class using ```new``` keyword.

**Constructors | no Arg**
* By default for a **class** if no constructors were provided, you are gonna get the **default constructor**.
* If you are providing a constructor then you have explicitly declare the no-arg constructor.

**Constructors | Argument**

```java
// Instantiating Account object with no argument constructor
Account account = new Account();
// Instantiting Account object with Argument constructor
Account account1 = new Account(1);
// All args constructor
Account account2 = new Account(1, "Checking");

class Account {
 public int id;
 public String name;   

 // no Args constructor
 public Account() {}

 // Argument constructor
 public Account (int id) {
    this.id = id;
 }

// All Argument constuctor
public Account(int id, String name){
    this.id = id;
    this.name = name;
}
}
```

## Access modifiers

### packages and import statements

* Always ```package``` declaration will come to the top of the class file.
* ```package``` as the name denotes it is hold set of classes in a package or in a organized way, kind of organizing your pictures in different folders.
* ```import``` statements comes after the ```package``` declaration.
* ```import``` as the denotes we are trying to import the class from different package to our pacakge.
